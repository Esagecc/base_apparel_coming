### What I learned

I used more of the top and left for setting the images in certain areas. I also learned to use the 100% width within a div to keep an image. It is very useful with responsive site. 

In the JS, I was challenged with email validation code. I looked for various resources and this site gave me the code that worked. https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php 

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I am planning to complete more Javascript project to build more confident with my skills. I am also completing the 100 Devs classes.
